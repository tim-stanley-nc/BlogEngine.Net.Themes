Circa 2008 BlogEngine.net Themes that used to be available at: 
http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/page/themes.aspx

Now at 11/2022, no longer seem to be available.

Several of the themes were created by Jesse Foster.  
Jesse explains more about how the different layouts are accomplished in his post on Layout Gala at http://www.gravitycube.net/blog/post/New-BlogEngine-Theme---ThemeEngineLayoutGala.aspx
Unfortunately, that link in 2022 no longer seems available.
