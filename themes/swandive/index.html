<h2>Welcome to Swan Dive</h2>
<p>Calm and cool.  Peaceful and uplifting.  Flying free.  Bearing gifts (see below).</p>
<p>This blog template validates as proper XHTML/CSS, with none of those pesky tables or proprietary tags to mess things up.</p>
<p>In an attempt to dress this baby up without the use of text as images, heading fonts have been defined using 
Pristina / Rage Italic / Brush Script MT / Georgia Italic / New Times Roman Italic / Times Italic.  These seem 
to be fairly common to most Windows and Mac installations nowadays.  If you're not seeing it, try modifying the 
style sheet to use a serif font set to italic to keep a sort of scripty look happening.</p>
<p>Thanks for looking!</p>

<h3>And now...  a bonus!</h3>
<p>Here is a recipe, inspired by the warm, fuzzy feelings we experienced upon realizing our new baby was 
ready for release.  With the template on the monitor in the background, we hit the kitchen and created this 
tasty treat in celebration.  Friends, let us present...</p>
<h4>Swan Dive Chicken</h4>
<p>
1 lb white meat chicken, trimmed and cubed<br />
1 large onion, sliced<br />
3 to 4 cloves of garlic, crushed and finely chopped<br />
1 Tbsp olive oil<br />
8 oz tomato sauce<br />
8 oz water<br />
1 tsp sugar<br />
1 Tbsp crushed red pepper<br />
1 Tbsp basil<br />
1 tsp oregano<br />
1/2 tsp tarragon<br />
1 can pitted black olives, drained<br />
kosher salt<br />
fresh ground black pepper<br />
</p>
<p>Rice:<br />
2 cups chicken broth, chicken stock, or water<br />
1 cup rice<br />
</p>
<p>Heat oil in skillet.  Salt and pepper the cubed chicken and toss into hot skillet with onion and garlic.</p>
<p>As chicken, onion and garlic cooks, sprinkle with a bit of the basil, oregano and tarragon.</p>
<p>In a sauce pan, bring the chicken broth, stock or water to a boil.</p>
<p>When chicken is browned, add tomato sauce, water, sugar, crushed red peper, and the remaining basil, 
oregano and tarragon.  Stir.</p>
<p>Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 - 25 minutes.</p>
<p>The liquid for the rice should be boiling now.  Add dry rice and stir.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 
20 minutes.</p>
<p>When rice is done, turn off the flame, fluff with a fork, replace the cover and let it sit for a moment.</p>
<p>Back to the chicken.  Remove cover from skillet and raise the flame to reduce the liquid a bit.  
Add black olives and cook for 5 more minutes.</p>
<p>Serve over a bed of rice with a salad on the side and a glass of your favorite wine.  At least one of 
you should be wearing a shirt about the same color of blue as the background behind this text for a perfect 
reproduction of the original warm fuzzies.</p>
<p>Serves 2 hungry designers, with a bit left over for lunch for 1 of them the next day.</p>

<h3>Steal this Design</h3>
<p>This template is released as an open source web design, which means that you are free to use it 
and edit it any way you wish for personal or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>All of the images used are royalty-free.  The swans are royalty-free clipart, and the other graphics were 
made by Homefront Studios.  There are no usage restrictions on any image.</p>
<p>We would feel the love if you'd leave the Homefront Studios link in the footer, or somewhere on your site, 
though it's not required.  If you use this template, we'd love to see it grow, so please, <a 
href="http://www.homefrontstudios.com/eme.asp">drop us a line</a> and tell us where we can sneak a peek 
at our little guy.</p>
<h3>Recipe Origins &amp; Tips</h3>
<p>The recipe on the left materialized almost like magic from the available contents in the Homefront Studios 
kitchen pantry.  Keep the basics on hand, and you'll always be able to whip up something tasty and unique.</p>
<p>Here's a tip.  Open your spices and smell them.  Select three that work together well.  You can get an 
idea of the direction of the taste this way.  Still unsure?  Start with one spice, and taste as you go.  If 
you smell your spices right after you take a taste, you'll know what else to add.</p>
<p>Hint:  Tomato base?  Basil, baby!</p>
<p>And remember...  Never skimp on the onion, garlic or basil.  Or black olives.  : )</p>
