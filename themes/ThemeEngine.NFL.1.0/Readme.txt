     Credits:  Original theme based on CoffeeHouse by Michael Sivers (http://michael.sivers.co.uk).
               CoffeeHouse is loosly based on the Dirtylicious by Viktor Persson (http://templates.arcsin.se).
               Dirtylicious was ported to BlogEngine.NET by RazorAnt (http://www.nyveldt.com/blog).
        Info:  ThemeEngine.NFL 1.0 is an experiment with dynamic templates in blogengine.  In summary, the 
               ThemeEngine.NFL theme is a collection of 32 differnet themes, all based on the same structure, 
               but different color schemes.  The concept is simular to csszengarden, but not nearly as
               sophisticated or well done.  A client side cookie is used to store the prefered theme chosen by
               the visitor.
