 Description:  More experimentation with dynamic stylesheets in a single theme.  This time, the source for the
               structure is from the Layout Gala (http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/) which is a collection of 
               40 layouts based on the same html structure.  This theme is an evolution from ThemeEngine.NFL, 
               which can also be downloaded for free from http://www.gravitycube.net/.
